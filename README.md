This repository contains files with Python programs for digit recognition using convolutional and fully connected neural networks. The Tensorflow was used for building the NNs. Networks were trained on the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

Contents:
* ConvolutionalNN.py: convolutional neural network,
* Perceptron: fully connected neural network.
